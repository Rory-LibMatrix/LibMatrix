# Rory&::LibMatrix

An extensible C# library for the Matrix protocol. Primarily built around our own project needs, but we're open to contributions and improvements, especially around spec compliance.
The library currently targets .NET 8. We like to follow the latest release of .NET.

ArcaneLibs can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/TheArcaneBrony/ArcaneLibs.git). Personally we use the [MatrixRoomUtils project](https://cgit.rory.gay/matrix/tools/MatrixRoomUtils.git/) as workspace, though improvements to make the library more easy to build outside of this would be appreciated.

# Installation

Probably add as a submodule for now? NuGet packaging still has to be implemented.
